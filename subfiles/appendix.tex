    \label{sec:appendix}

    % Please limit the main part of the report to 20 pages (not including the references, the statement of originality, and the appendix).

    % In your appendix, you can add any additional details about your work, such as:
    % \begin{itemize}
    %     \item extra results that do not necessarily belong in Sec. \ref{sec:evaluation}
    %     \item more detailed justifications of certain algorithm design decisions
    %     \item algorithm proofs
    % \end{itemize}

    % Additionally, in the case of using AI assistants, describe in detail what content was generated using an AI assistant.
    % In particular, name the AI assistant(s) that you used and how they were used (e.g. which prompts were used, and for which parts of the project).
